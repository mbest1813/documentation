## Getting Started with OutBrain and MetaRouter

***Note:** This connector supports client-side analytics.js only.  You also need to have instrumented MetaRouter [inside your website](../sources/analyticsjs.md) prior to enabling this connector.*

### OutBrain Side

To get started sending events to OutBrain, all you're gonna need is your `Advertiser Id`, which you'll see as soon as you create your account and start a campaign.

### MetaRouter Side

Once you've identified your `Advertiser ID`, go ahead to your [MetaRouter dashboard](app.metarouter.io) and add OutBrain as a destination under your client-side connection.

Give your connection a unique name and input that `Advertiser ID` where asked.

Lastly, input the OutBrain events you want to track. This is something like: `email_sign_up`.

Click on `Save` at the bottom of the form to activate your pipeline.

Once your pipeline is activated, navigate over to the `Logs` or `Analytics` section to monitor live data. 

With that - you're ready for insights!
